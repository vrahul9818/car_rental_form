I have hosted the MySQL database on phpMyAdmin with a free tier setup, where it automatically uses the seeder and migration files to upsert vehicle data and create the Booking and Vehicle tables if they donâ€™t already exist. This setup is accessible directly on phpMyAdmin.


Hosted config is already done so no need to change Backend file for it .

Directly Clone the repository from GIT and use npm start to run both frontend and backend

In the index.js file within the Backend folder, DB_NAME = DB_ARR[0] (PHP HOSTED)
In the Backend folder,  Models -> index.js a env = env_arr[0] 

However if you want  run it locally, follow these steps to make changes:

Install MySQL on your local system and run it in the background.
In the index.js file within the Backend folder, update DB_NAME = DB_ARR[0] (PHP HOSTED) to DB_ARR[1] (LOCAL SQL) and change DATABASE_URL=DATABASE_URL_ARR[0] (PHP HOSTED)  to DATABASE_URL_ARR[1] (LOCAL SQL).
In the Backend folder, go to Models -> index.js and set const env = env_arr[0]  (PHP HOSTED to env_arr[1] (LOCAL SQL).
